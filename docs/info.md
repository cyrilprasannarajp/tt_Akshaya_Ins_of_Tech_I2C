# I2C Master Controller

## How it works

This project implements a simple I2C master controller.

When the START input is asserted, the controller begins transmitting an 8-bit data value serially over the SDA line while generating the SCL clock.

The controller generates:

* START condition
* 8-bit serial transmission
* STOP condition

The BUSY output indicates an active transfer.

## How to test

1. Apply reset.
2. Place an 8-bit value on ui_in.
3. Assert START.
4. Observe SCL and SDA activity.
5. Monitor BUSY until transmission completes.

## External hardware

An I2C slave device, logic analyzer, or oscilloscope may be connected to observe SDA and SCL signals.
